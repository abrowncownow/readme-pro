## Installation

  Clone the repository from github to your local machine. Navigate to the folder directory in your CLI. Enter "npm i" to install the necessary modules. Then enter "node index.js" to run Readme Gen Pro 9000.

## Usage

  Upon running Readme Gen Pro 9000, you will be promted to provide details regarding your project. Answer the prompts thoroughly for a detailed final readme! Optional- you may enter raw markup language for an improved experience. Once all of the prompts are completed, a "ProjectTitle_readme.md" will be created in the ./generated_readmes directory. You can create multiple readmes by changing the title entered during the prompts. If you re-use the same title, the same-named reademe in ./generated_readmes will be over-written.
